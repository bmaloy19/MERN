# ComSci319-Final
This app was created as a final project for ComSci 319. Our final project for this class includes a single webpage containing a catalog of products developed for a small business: Nordland Forge. 
General features of this webpage include the ability to show all of the products, as well as adding removing, and updating any product. 
This information is stored in a MongoDB database, and any changes made to products are done there. 
Along with using Mongo, we used Express, Node, and Javascript in the backend. The front end uses software such as React and CSS.
In the front end, we implemented a footer that allows one to view an About page, which explains the origin of this business.
Additionally, the footer contains a credits page that documents the website's creators and the class it was created for.

To run the app, open 2 instances of your editor such as VScode (one in the frontend folder and one in the backend folder) and run: npm start in both directories.
